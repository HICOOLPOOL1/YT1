## Deprecation Notice
```
After 6 - 10 months of no updates, It's time to deprecate this project. Even though i see somebody open a issue during a day that does not has update, still i respond to them.

I really had no idea of what am i doing after the past 6 months. Seriously, I'M LAZY AS HECK! You see, 3-5 Planned features that were planned since 6 MONTHS AGO IS NEVER IMPLEMENTED FOR THE PAST 6 MONTHS!

Every hours i'm busy and selling some stuff in my shop. Which can also the reason why i can't maintain this repository longer. You can also say that i can't maintain this repo longer due to life issue. I'm busy, tho. Scrolling through Telegram, Twitter, and Mastodon everytime when i'm bored and had no idea of what to do.

Believe me or no, The frontend code (Right in views folder) is mostly a copy paste result in Bootstrap example. Unbelieveable, Isn't it? This project also my random-bored project that i made when i had no idea of what am i doing in some hours.

So yeah. I think this is the end, But not the end. Since the code is open, Somebody may fork it and improve this project with their own.

Thanks for the 36 starts on github. I really appreciate it.

That's it. See you next time, folks.

Bye.
